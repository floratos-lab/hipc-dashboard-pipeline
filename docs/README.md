# Overview

Curation templates are utilized to
record immune signatures, i.e., published research findings that
describe how immune exposures (e.g., infection, immunization) modulate
the abundance of biologically important response components (e.g.,
genes, cell subpopulations). Immune signatures typically reflect a
comparison between two subject groups (e.g., patients with severe
infection vs. patients with mild infection). Curation templates can
contain multiple rows, each row corresponding to a single immune
signature. As many rows as needed can be used to capture all pertinent
immune signatures in a publication.

Currently there are two curation templates in use, one each for two
exposure types (vaccination, infection).

    the data fields comprising the HIPC Dashboard curation templates.
    The spreadsheet contains four sheets: ***shared*** (columns shared by all
    templates.), ***infection*** (columns used in
    templates used to curate infection signatures), ***vaccination*** (columns used in
    templates used to curate vaccination signatures), and 
	***pick lists*** (lists of permissible values).
