Additional information for curators		Any characteristics of the population(s) studied, besides age.  Example:  Hong Kong, Atlanta  Also report if the result was limited to a subgroup of the tested cohort, e.g.  - subjects suffering adverse events  - particular threshold levels of antibody titer level - based on a receiving a particular treatment	include both case/affected and control subjects	include both case/affected and control subjects	hours, days, months, years	Often differs by signature within a publication. If number of subjects for a particular signature is not clear in text, use total for cohort.	The parent tissue of the response components.  Report multiple tissues in different rows.   For cell-type results, the tissue is often PBMCs.  For gene expression, the tissue might be a particular cell-type.	If there is no matching cell type in the pulldown list, the curator can try to look up a matching term in the  Cell Ontology. If there is no appropriate Cell Ontology term, UBERON codes can also be used.	The primary experimental method used to measure the response, e.g.  RNA-seq, CyTOF, CITE-seq. 	The entities whose response is being measured.  Please copy symbols and names exactly as reported in the publication - except spell out greek letters.  For cell types, this includes all markers.  Examples for a signature with three cell types: T cells CD3+/CD4+/Ki67+; T cells CD3+/CD8+/Ki67+ CD86+ myeloid dendritic cell (DC); CD86+ monocyte	Were the response components chosen using a classification or other model-building strategy?	The type of change being measured, e.g. gene expression, cell-type frequency.	Common values in the pulldown list: - up, down - positively correlated, negatively correlated, correlated - positively predictive, negatively predictive, predictive	Comparisons are typically between two groups, or may reflect a  correlation of the response component with some other measured variable.   Only report significant results.   Examples: - severe COVID-19 cases vs healthy - moderate COVID-19 cases vs healthy; severe COVID-19 cases vs healthy - interferon-stimulated genes in COVID-19 vs healthy - bacterial DNA levels across COVID-19 and healthy subjects Include time comparison if relevant, e.g. 7d vs 0d, where the times are relative to the baseline reference event time (0d). Times before baseline event can be entered as negative numbers, e.g. days before vaccination (7d vs -1d). **Please be concise.**	The reference event from which the time of the experimental response  is measured, e.g. hospital admission, onset of symptoms	Time point when response was measured, if available. 	days, months etc.	Enter the pathogen or vaccine underlying the immune exposure as reported in the publication or use the NCBI Taxonomy term name	NCBI Taxonomy ID of pathogen causing disease. Use format id_type:id, e.g. ncbi_taxid:2697049	Method by which exposure to pathogen occurred		Reported disease stage(s) of affected subjects in all comparisons entered in row (not including control subjects).
