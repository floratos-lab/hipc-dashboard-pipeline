HIPC Dashboard Pipeline

Changes in version 1.2.0
- Update column headers:
-- baseline_time to baseline_time_event
-- exposure_material to exposure_material_id
-- publication_reference to publication_reference_id
- New columns added by pipeline now added at end of templates rather than at fixed locations
- Use tab-delimited files rather than Excel for all input and public output files
- Change code to extract pubmed publish date (may be epub for some), 
   and remove more complex code to construct pubmed-based print publish date
- Use publication_year column for actual print year.
* No longer reconstruct article abstract from xml. 
    It preserved special characters that are not wanted.
    Only used by mSigDB code.
