Changes in version 1.2.1
- update some signatures to clarify comparison column entries
- update observation summary template to match change to Dashboard special character handling (left-paren, ampersand) 

Changes in version 1.2.0
- Update column headers:
-- baseline_time to baseline_time_event
-- exposure_material to exposure_material_id
-- exposure_material_text to exposure_material
-- publication_reference to publication_reference_id
-- submission_date to curation_date
-- extra_comments to curator_comments
- Remove certain columns from templates:
-- remove submission_name and template_name, as values are generated in code
-- remove addntl_time_point_units, group1 and group0 because not in use
- Merge certain columns into cohort and remove from templates
-- merge subgroup into cohort, remove subgroup and update code
-- merge age_group into cohort, remove age_group
- New columns added by pipeline now added at end of templates rather than at fixed locations
- Use tab-delimited files rather than Excel for all input and public output files
- Change code to extract pubmed publish date (may be epub for some), 
    and remove more complex code to construct pubmed-based print publish date
- Use publication_year column for actual print year.  
    Previously retrieved from Pubmed as PubDate option but value not always present.
- No longer reconstruct article abstract from xml. 
    It preserved special characters that are not wanted.
    Only used by mSigDB code.
- Add time_point, time_point_units, and baseline_time_event to observation summary statements to disambiguate.
- Add additional_exposure_material to observation summary statements if it has an entry (most do not).
- Template data cleaning:
-- change all ontology references to type:value format
-- remove confirmed redundant subgroup entries
- Add this file (changelog.txt) and HIPC_Dashboard_curation_template_fields.pdf to project.
