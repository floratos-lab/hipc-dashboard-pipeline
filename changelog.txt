HIPC Dashboard Pipeline

Changes in version 1.3.1
- Add splitting on comparison field entries (split 5)
- Add splitting on tissue_type_term_id (split 4).
-- Split tissue_type_term_ids get individual columns in Dashboard submission files
- Adapt code to new directory structure in github repository
- change "recreated_templates" to "standardized_curations" in output file names
- Rename submission id variables in code and standardized files for clarity
-- subm_obs_id -> sig_subm_id, uniq_obs_id -> sig_row_id
- Revise messages in code for clarity
- Separate writing tab-delimited and csv versions of standardized submission files to different, specifiable directories
- fix problem with logging using log_no_valid_symbol_vs_pmid()
- "pmid:" tags now removed immediately

Changes in version 1.3.0
- Support new exposure type: infection (COVID-19 studies)
- For subject type "cell_subset", use cell ontology ids instead of display names.
  This concerns tissue types (column tissue_type_term_id) and cell-type response components (column response_component_id)
- For subject type "pathogen", use NCBI taxonomy ids instead of display names 
  (columns target_pathogen_taxonid for vaccine, exposure_material_id for infection).
- For tissue types, support parsing out cell ontology IDs from curator-oriented data validation pulldown values added to templates:
-- The pulldown value is shown first. Just the term is also permitted:
     CL:0000624 (CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell)
     CL:0000624
- For target pathogens in the vaccine templates, support parsing out NCBI taxonomy IDs 
  from curator-oriented data validation pulldown values added to templates:
-- The pulldown value is shown first.  The other values are also accepted:
    “ncbi_taxid:11090 (Yellow fever virus 17D)”
    “ncbi_taxid:11090”
    “11090”  (defaults to NCBI taxonomy id)
- In the target_pathogen_taxonid column of vaccine templates, for influenza vaccine entries, 
  allow use of lookup tags for taxonomy ids.  The tags will be replaced by the actual viral 
  components of the vaccine, looked up in the file "vaccine_years.txt.  Multiple entries are allowed.
-- For example
     “influ:2008” will be substituted with the several actual viral components of the vaccine for year 2008.
     “influ:2007; influ:2008; influ:2009” will be substituted with the union of the three year's viral components.
- Add ability to return vaccine pathogen component NCBI taxonomy ids to lookup function.
- Gene lookup using the NCBI data file now also checks the nomenclature_authority column (HGNC).  
  If a query symbol is not found in the official NCBI symbols or aliases, 
  but IS found in the nomenclature_authority column, the NCBI official symbol is substituted.
- Create pathogen and cell_subset lookup-values for curation sheets.  Format is e.g.
-- “ncbi_taxid:11090 (Yellow fever virus 17D)”
-- "CL:2000001 (peripheral blood mononuclear cell)"
- The following formats are also accepted
-- “ncbi_taxid:11090”
-- "CL:2000001"
-- “11090”  (tissues only, defaults to NCBI taxonomy id)


Changes in version 1.2.1
- update observation summary template to match change to Dashboard special character handling (left-paren, ampersand) 


Changes in version 1.2.0
- Update column headers:
-- baseline_time to baseline_time_event
-- exposure_material to exposure_material_id
-- exposure_material_text to exposure_material
-- publication_reference to publication_reference_id
-- submission_date to curation_date
-- extra_comments to curator_comments
- Remove certain columns from templates:
-- remove submission_name and template_name, as values are generated in code
-- remove addntl_time_point_units, group1 and group0 because not in use
- New columns added by pipeline now added at end of templates rather than at fixed locations
- Use tab-delimited files rather than Excel for all input and public output files
- Change code to extract pubmed publish date (may be epub for some), 
    and remove more complex code to construct pubmed-based print publish date
- Use publication_year column for actual print year.  
    Previously retrieved from Pubmed as PubDate option but value not always present.
- No longer reconstruct article abstract from xml. 
    It preserved special characters that are not wanted.
    Only used by mSigDB code.
- Add time_point, time_point_units, and baseline_time_event to observation summary statements to disambiguate.
- Add additional_exposure_material to observation summary statements if it has an entry (most do not).
- Add this file (changelog.txt) and HIPC_Dashboard_curation_template_fields.pdf to project.
