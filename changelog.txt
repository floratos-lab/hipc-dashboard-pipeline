HIPC Dashboard Pipeline

Changes in version 1.2.0
- Update column headers:
-- baseline_time to baseline_time_event
-- exposure_material to exposure_material_id
-- exposure_material_text to exposure_material
-- publication_reference to publication_reference_id
-- submission_date to curation_date
-- extra_comments to curator_comments
- Remove certain columns from templates:
-- remove submission_name and template_name,
     as values are generated in code
-- remove addntl_time_point_units, group1 and group0 because not in use
- New columns added by pipeline now added at end of templates rather than at fixed locations
- Use tab-delimited files rather than Excel for all input and public output files
- Change code to extract pubmed publish date (may be epub for some), 
    and remove more complex code to construct pubmed-based print publish date
- Use publication_year column for actual print year.  
    Previously retrieved from Pubmed as PubDate option but value not always present.
- No longer reconstruct article abstract from xml. 
    It preserved special characters that are not wanted.
    Only used by mSigDB code.
